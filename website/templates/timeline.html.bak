            <li>August 2022: Project start: initial concept drawings made.</li>
            <li>
                August 2022: First, most important question answered: Is the standard 3-pin ARGB connector something you can just plug into an Arduino and control?
                Answer: Yes. The FastLED library exists for exactly this purpose, and works with a number of common ARGB protocols.
                As it turns out, the CoolerMaster fans I have use the most common of these protocols.
            </li>
            <li>24th August 2022: First successful test with Arduino-controlled ARGB devices.</li>
            <li>28th August 2022: First prototype controller with temperature-based color control.</li>
            <li>1st September 2022: Successfully salvaged VU meters from Technics 612 Cassette Tape Deck.</li>
            <li>15th September 2022: Prototype ARGB controller upgraded with manual HSV color control. Expanded circuit to include all ARGB devices in my PC. Issues with color stablity persist.</li>
            <li>22nd September 2022: Built and tested VU meter driver circuit from JLM Audio.</li>
            <li>22nd November 2022: Solved issue of random noise on ARGB color lines by removing wall-wart power supplies from the circuit. Successfully tested powering circuit off my old PC PSU.</li>
            <li>4th December 2022: First prototype control panel: ARGB control circuit in place under PC monitor with steady power from PC PSU, plus VU meters in place atop SoundCard.</li>
            <li>December 2022: Expanded prototype control panel with PC audio output device control.</li>
            <li>December 2022: Expanded prototype control panel with Manual/Temperature-based color control.</li>
            <li>December 2022: Expanded prototype control panel with additional potentiometer from Technics 612.</li>
            <li>December 2022: Expanded prototype control panel with PC volume control. Includes main volume control and app-specific volume control.</li>
            <li>December 2022: Expanded prototype control panel with soft-takeover logic between potentiometer modes.</li>
            <li>January 2023: At some point in here the color control started having issues again. One fan in particular was noisy in certain Hue ranges, and all fans were struggling to replicate white. Limiting the maximum output brightness solved both issues: still no idea why.</li>
            <li>22nd January 2023: Began work on prototype control panel faceplate. Faceplate constructed out of single piece of MDF for ease of manufacture. Actually, it went really well, translating from the journal page to the MDF markdown easily and with no major reworks required.</li>
            <li>23rd January 2023: Completed prototype faceplate; wiring not completed yet, but just having it there under my monitor, in-place and actual-size, is incredibly satisfying.</li>
            <li>24th January 2023: Completed wiring up the prototype control panel. This was two days of patient soldering to get jumper cables long enough to snake out from behind the faceplate, leaving the breadboard accessible. The wiring itself went off mostly without a hitch, with only a few minor reworks identified over the following day or two.</li>
            <li>26th January 2023: Completed prototype control panel (finally) by finishing re-wiring the faceplate into the Arduino/breadboard. Managed to significantly reduce the size of the breadboard by consolidating most of the wiring onto the Arduino board itself; besides the I/O pins it's mostly just 5V/Gnd connections.</li>
            <li>31st January 2023: Took delivery of a 7-inch, 5-color E-ink display for the centre of the faceplate. It looks great even with nothing on it.</li>
            <li>1st February 2023: Started testing Arduino code to control mains outlets via RF and air-conditioning unit via IR. IR hardware works but the protocol is not recognised: should just be a software/library fix. RF hardware does not appear to work but it's just a 5-dollar breakout, and some of the forum folk seem to those can be dodgy: looking like more of a hardware fix.</li>
