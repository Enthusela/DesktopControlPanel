Feature development.Clean power, yo.So as mentioned in the previous one, I've discovered that the ARGB devices in my computer require very clean, consistent DC power in order to operate correctly.Anything else, if there's any noise in the line from external sources, that would throw out any very tightly timed data signaling on the data line and we'd be up shit creek.So, this should be a short one.What do I have that, or rather, sorry, stopping it.So, key point, enter, enter.I need to find a power supply that could supply very clean, noise-free power at 5 volts, minimum 6 amps, and ideally would also be able to power at 12 volts or have a separate supply of the same type of 12 volts for other electronics stuff, or for ARGB LED strips.End of key point.Enter, enter.So, now looking online, obviously these things do exist.Turns out desktop power supplies are the kind, sort of like black box type, they're common.I was having a bit of a time finding one that would operate at low enough voltage and high enough wattage, sort of like looking at 30 watts.They exist, but they're a bit expensive and they were in surprisingly short supply.Power supplies, so key points, enter, enter.Power supplies, that kind of low voltage, high amperage output, they did exist, but they were few and far between and a little bit more expensive than I liked.So, it wasn't the ideal solution.End of key point.New key point, enter, enter.Turns out I did have something that fit all the criteria, which was the 650 watt power supply lurking in my old PC case.This output, as I said, up to 650 watts, shared between 5 volt power supply, 5 volt power supply rails, 12 volt power supply rails, and 3.3 volt power supply rails, which are the three most common power supply levels for electronics in general.End of key point, enter, enter.Going into a bit more detail, I had, as I said, recently rebuilt my PC, new case, new GPU, which meant new power supply.So, I had almost an entire PC sitting in my storage unit.And the PSU, which was a couple hundred bucks worth, was just sitting there unused.And in retrospect, it makes perfect sense that this would be ideal.PCs are obviously very electrically noisy environments.There's an insane amount of components crammed in together, all operating at different voltages.Some operating at very high power rates, like the GPU.My GPU is like 750 watts or something.The design criteria is basically the same.You have a lot of components that are potentially very sensitive to noise, operating at very high speeds and very high power at different low voltages.So, yeah, PSU is perfect.I'm a little ashamed of the first test I did, which basically involved me soldering, trying to desolder the ATX power socket from the motherboard and not succeeding.And so, instead, just soldering it to the back end through pin connector thingies and just plugging that shit into my breadboard.There's an image there, but good god, it was a terrible thing.I've eventually settled on this new, slightly less hacky, possibly more dangerous method of just holding over breadboard jumper cables that are thick enough to be press fit into the loose ATX power pins.It works, you know, if I push it in right, it's shielded.It's not ideal, but I've been doing it for a couple months now and so far, so good.So, key point here, a couple hacky methods later, I've got a very reliable 5V power supply running to LEDs.Key point, new one, enter, enter.As expected, or as hoped, rather, as soon as I plugged in 5V from the PSU, the noise issue disappeared and it's been very consistent.Note that I still have some issue with miscoloration where it doesn't appear so much that the data is changing or being corrupted when sent to the LEDs, but it's just not quite right.It's an issue with white, some devices will go to more of an orange and the problem seems to get worse with time.I'm not sure what that's about.I'll figure it out later.But key point in summary, power supply unit for my old PC became the new power supply unit for the control panel.The 5V power supply was sufficient and sufficiently clean to run everything.PC case LEDs now under my complete control with some adjustments and the 12V output from the power supply opens the door to running powerful other ARGB scripts.I tend to run on micro volts from the control panel and indeed any other circuitry I might want to run.Do it.Yes, in fact, 3.3V I'm using to simulate two AA batteries that would be in the RF remote where if I hang.Man, I'm getting sleepy.
