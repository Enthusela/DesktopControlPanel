Side note for feature ideation, volume control, obviously I would want another knob basically for the main volume control.So I think that, I forget whether this came before or after the idea for the separate app volume control, but either way at some point I decided well I want another volume control knob that just does overall PC volume and that would also be really easy because the sound card itself has its own sort of run of, you know, gain stages and knobs and shit that I'd rather not touch.I just want one nice dedicated PC volume knob.Yeah.
