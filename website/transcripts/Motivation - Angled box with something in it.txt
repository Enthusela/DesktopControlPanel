Ok, so I said originally this whole project was blah blah blah, so how do I get from that to this? Well I guess I would say that once I had that idea and I said ok well look I'm going to angle it up.I mean originally it was just going to be a box, just a box, a wood box just to angle it up kind of like this and then we can have an image here, colon, one of the mood board images showing a piece of equipment in a wood box, there's like a machine, something like that is in there, so this is it.But then while I was looking at these things I started seeing all these old school music studio control panels that have the same sort of thing, they have a whole lot of integrated equipment, it's all kind of angled and presented to be a very clean and accessible user interface and I thought oh well that's really cool, but what would I put? You know right now I just have this one, this one sound card thing, I've got nothing else.So that was where it started, I had the box and then I saw some even cooler boxes and then I thought ok well if I can build a cooler box what can I have in it? So that's sort of the core question, enter, enter.So moving on, I've decided for the box what I'll put in it and at the same time I was having an issue which is that I've just designed this PC, well I've just fully rebuilt my PC, it's got a super clean look, it looks really nice and it's full of these ARGB LEDs which I'm thinking, like they're good and they work but I'm dealing with a lot of bullshit, what do you call it, like manufacturer software that you have to use to design them and trying to get them all synced up is ok when they're all one manufacturer and the software works but then of course I have items from different manufacturers and I have even items within the same manufacturer don't necessarily have the same specs and so trying to get it all to work was difficult enough as a box.So that's point two there.Point two, ARGB controllability devices is difficult, which brings us to point three which is I want my whole apartment to look nice and the PC is part of that.When I was starting the PC I had a whole lot of ideas about, actually let's simplify this down a bit.
