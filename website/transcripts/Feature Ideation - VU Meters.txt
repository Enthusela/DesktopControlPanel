Okay, so, um, VU meters.So, I'm not sure exactly where I came up with this, I think it's just something I've always liked, but at some point, while I was coming up with functionality that could go onto the control panel, I hit on VU meters.These are these little sort of needle-based old-school analog level indicators.I just think they're really cool.You know, they have sort of warm, they fit the aesthetic, they add sort of like warm DC lamps on top that sort of light up and shine in when they're in use, and they have a very sort of analog physical operation where the speed of the needle is actually damped by the weight of it, and the sort of angular momentum naturally smooths out the kind of sharp peaks and troughs and acts as a natural kind of high-pass filter on the signal, and I just think they're really cool.So, pretty much right from the bat, I was like, okay, I want to get some EQ to put these in.Also, they are a, VU meters are obviously a very common feature of old-school music studios of the kind that I'm trying to emulate.So I think pretty much as soon as that part locked in, I thought, well, yeah, this is cool, and this should definitely be in there.
