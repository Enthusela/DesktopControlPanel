Okay, so where am I at? I know I want to make my apartment look sweet, and I know as part of that I want to make my PC desk setup emulate the look of a music studio.To do that I want to develop some kind of control panel thing that can be integrated into my setup and look really cool.And I know that I'm going to need to come up with some equipment, or some functionality I can build into it to make up the space, because right now I have all this space to build a control panel in, the bigger the better, and all I have is the sound card.
