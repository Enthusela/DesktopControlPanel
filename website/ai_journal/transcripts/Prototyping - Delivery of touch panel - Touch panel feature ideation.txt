Ideation: The touchscreen panel was actually the very last feature to be added. Adding a touch-panel to the e-ink display occurred to me very early on in the project, but I put it in the "too hard/adds complexity" bucket, where it stayed until I'd almost completed modeling the control panel in CAD. At that point I had a small amount of empty space on the faceplate where I was considering putting a joystick as the control input for the e-ink display. It looked okay, but it didn't really fit the aesthetic of the project, adding a kind of gamer-spec, plasticky, rubberized texture to the whole look that I wasn't happy with. It would also look a bit messy, being a control input awkwardly located on the audio side of the unit, opposite the rest of the controls. Overall it just didn't really click as part of the design; its presence wasn't satisfying the way I'd managed to make the rest of the components.

Sourcing the hardware: This got me circling back round to the touch-screen idea, so late one night I set about answering the question: "Is it cheap and easy to add a touch overlay to an E-Ink display?" It turns out the answer is "Cheap, yes; easy, maybe!" (I did also consider replacing the e-ink panel with one with a built-in touch panel, but didn't find anything suitable or cheap enough to justify the additional cost/rework). I very quickly found the LattePanda 7" Display Touch Panel Overlay. The LattePanda is a Windows single-board computer (SBC) with dedicated connectors for an external display and a touch-panel overlay; the overlay I found is intended for use with the manufacturer's 7" LattePanda external display. As luck would have it, the dimensions of the panel seemed ideal for my e-ink display; it looked no more than two millimetres thick, so it would sit between the faceplate and the e-ink display without interfering with the mounting system I'd come up with. Best of all, it was 30 bucks. Beautiful.

Dimensions and connectivity: While the price was right, I did have a lot of fun figuring out whether it was actually going to work in my project. I ended up buying it essentially as a punt because, try as I might, I couldn't find clear documentation on the dimensions and connectivity of the panel. I found multiple sources for what appeared to be the outer dimensions that implied that the bezel would overlap the e-ink display; other sources suggested those same measurements were actually for the active touch panel area, which would imply little or no overlap. Connectivity was similarly vague, with the official documentation simply listing a "10cm FPC extension cable". It wasn't until I went digging through the specs for the LattePanda itself, images of the board, and miscellanious support forums (as is so often the way) that I finally came up with a good guess as to what connection and protocol this thing uses. For those interested, it's a 6-pin, 0.5mm-pitch FFC that <i>should</i> be compatible with I2C. The vague specs make some sense given the overlay is marketed as an attachment for another display within the LattePanda ecosystem, but considering how maker-friendly SBCs usually are I'm surprised there wasn't more specific information available from the manufacturer. Nevertheless, armed with my educated guess I added the screen and a few different FFC sockets to my cart, and now I'm just hoping that it turns out correctly. Good stuff.

Unboxing: Alright, taking delivery of the touchscreen. So from the top, it looks good. It's nicely packaged. It smells like a game - you know when you open up a new video game and it has that plasticky smell inside? Yeah, it smells good. It's solid, it's surprisingly heavy, I'm guessing that's because it is actually in glass or some kind of very solid polymer, so that's good.

Dimensions and fit: I actually wasn't sure when I purchased it what the dimensions of the bezel were.  I found the confusion interesting given they're both marketed as seven inch panels, but what can you do. Now I have it that I can confirm that it's definitely smaller than the e-ink display. I'm losing maybe five millimeters off the top and sides, and almost ten millimeters off the bottom, so not ideal, but it'll still work. It also has the benefit now of the actual bezel around the touchscreen overlay being a nice dark, shiny black, which could smooth out the color transition between the black aluminium faceplate and the somewhat washed-out black of the E-Ink display.

Connectivity revisited: Now I have the panel and FPC sockets in my hands, it's very obvious that the 1mm-pitch socket is way too wide, but the 0.5mm-pitch one looks correct. Looking at these sockets I do believe however I have made something of an oversight. When I purchased these connectors I could see from the images that while they were surface mount devices they clearly had some protruding pins, in fact I picked them specifically to have protruding pins that I could solder onto for the prototype. In my somewhat frenzied state of purchasing though, it didn't quite twig for me that these are going to be really, really small: specifically, you know, 0.5mm apart. The pins on the sockets are indeed tiny.

I'm going to have to figure out a way to do that. Either I'm going to have to solder with a very steady hand or possibly bust out a bit of copper and a Stanley knife or something. We'll figure it out. Yes we will.

Continuing on, or rather this proceeds the formal discussion about the E-Ink display.
Obviously I've taken delivery of it now but just some thoughts on how I got there.
