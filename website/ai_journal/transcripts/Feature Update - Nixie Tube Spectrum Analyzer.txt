Okay, so, feature update Nixie Tubes.This is actually probably the last feature, in fact yes it is the last feature that I added in before I decided that the prototype was ready for actual modelling, and it came about because of a quirk of gaming ergonomics.All of the volume knobs for separate PC app volume control and all that stuff, and the colour control as well, were on the right side of the case and that was deliberate because, you know what, this is way too much detail, no one cares.So, starting again from when I said the last thing to get updated, whatever the fuck, um, so I had moved the main volume control knob over to the right to make it easier to access while using the computer, and that left a big open space right next to the VU meters, so I thought, well what, what can go here, you know, what would be good, I have all this space.And, I'm not sure exactly what prompted this thought, but along the line of VU meters, I really like, or rather, no sorry, what I want to say, I have this space, it's right next to the VU meters, and it's sort of on the side, which is kind of like the audio side, you have the sound card there, and you have the VU meters.So, I'm thinking, okay, well what can I add to that sort of audio side, and the natural kind of thought that came to mind was, well, an audio spectrum analyzer.I already have the VU meters there, which are effectively like a level analyzer, they tell me how loud it is, if I'm going down the route of having a kind of audio, you know, control panel feedback section, well, a spectrum analyzer that shows how loud the relative frequency range is, like low, mid, high, that would be really cool.I thought, well, you know, if I'm doing that, okay, cool, but is there a way to make an audio spectrum analyzer look and feel kind of analog? You know, you can get a lot of ones that are based on sort of like LCD displays, or like, you know, digital LEDs that kind of light up in a row, and show you things that way, but it wasn't really fitting with the aesthetic of the thing, so I thought, is there a way to make it analog? That's what I ate, that old-school look.And there is, and ironically, it's actually kind of new school, but it ended up being sort of the perfect combination of, I guess, old school and new school, but mostly old school.Anyway, it was analog, and it was Nixie tubes.So I googled analog spectrum analyzer just to see what came up, and before long, I came across the NixieLyzer Nixie tube based audio spectrum analyzer.Which uses a particular kind of Nixie tube, the IN9, which is a kind of linear indicator.As you increase the voltage, rather than increasing the brightness, it sort of shoots up and down, and the NixieLyzer uses six of them arranged vertically, and each of the six tubes represents one band of the audio spectrum, left to right, low to high.And I thought, perfect! I didn't have enough space for a full six, but after some measurements, and after some adjustments, and confirming, you know, can this actually work, because it'll end up pretty squished up together, I did, and confirmed, yes, this can work.And so that was that.And with that, all the space on my control panel was filled, and it was time to model.
