All right, journal entry titled, the first ARGB controller prototype, including temperature control.
So this was the first feature that I really needed to test for the control panel.
This kind of made cool break, because if I couldn't get this to work, then, well, there wasn't really much point in proceeding.
So my thought process was, well, we've got these ARGB devices, these fans, and they just have a three-pin header connection.
That is it.
And one of those pins is power, and one is ground, naturally.
So yeah, the last one stopped.
So the question was just, OK, well, whatever's coming out on that data pin, is that something that an Arduino can emulate, basically? Or I suppose, in theory, Raspberry Pi.
But I have an Arduino, so I tested it with an Arduino.
And I got lucky right off the bat.
As it turns out, this is somewhat unsurprisingly not the first time someone's tried to do something like this.
And libraries definitely exist for Arduino to control ARGB devices like this - or not necessarily like this; rather, exist to control ARGB devices in general, specifically ARGB strips of the kind that you see on Amazon and that kind of thing.
So I found a couple libraries, one in particular, quite popular, called the FastLED Library.
And then, oh, hang on.
Hello? Yes, I'll come down right away.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
So I'm not sure if that worked, but I'm going to stop it there and start again, because I got a delivery.
