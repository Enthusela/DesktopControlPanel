feature ideation motorized takeover.So I've described soft takeover where you have to physically move a control input to the position that is associated with...Wow, this is a wordy thing to say.How do I simplify this? So soft takeover means that if you switch a control input to a certain mode, the value associated with that mode won't change unless the control input matches it.So what that means is the user, if you've left, say, volume on, you know, half and then with that same knob you then go and set a color value to full, well when you switch back to volume you're going to have to move that knob back to half before the volume value changes.And then if you keep moving it down from half to 49%, 48%, then the value will change.Now I did get that working, soft takeover, and to help the user I implemented a couple lights, left and right lights on each knob, which basically showed you, okay, which direction do you need to move to get the soft takeover to come up or to match.And as you got closer the lights got brighter and brighter and brighter so that you could get an idea of how close you were and then they went out when it matched up.Now that worked, but the code was a bit fiddly and it wasn't the most satisfying because it sort of added an extra step.So one idea I had, which at first I thought would be a bit too tricky to implement, but I thought was really, really cool was motorized takeover, where rather than, you know, the code sees that the control output doesn't match the associated control variable and it tells you to basically move it and keeps it the same until it happens, when it detects the difference it will actually physically drive the control surface to the correct position.And there's a precedent for this because, and it ties back to the old music studio thing because music studio mixing desks often have motorized volume faders and that allows you to do a whole bunch of cool shit, which I won't get into, but the point is it exists and it can be done and I've seen it done and it looks really cool and I thought that would be awesome, but I'll put it on the back burner for now and just see how the soft takeover thing works out.
