Originally, this whole project started with the simple desire to have my sound card angled up slightly, kind of like a music studio control panel, so that it felt more like a deliberately placed part of the setup rather than an afterthought placed wherever it fit.
"Kind of like a music studio" is a common theme in this project.
Music studios, particularly older ones, have a lot to like.
They're warm spaces, designed for long periods of occupation, with very intentional layouts designed for optimal acoustics, which is both functional and ergonomic in the sense that it enables comfortable listening for long periods.
The layouts are also designed to allow efficient access to a large amount of space-consuming equipment, often where space is actually in short supply, not plentiful as you'd like it to be.
Music studios, especially older ones, also tend to be full of analogue equipment.
Whether this equipment is better is a topic for another blog, so what objective qualities do they possess that appeal to me? Heavy and solidly built.
Tactile, meaning little or no plastic, lots of wood and metal, tactile controls, and tactile feedback.
Infinite variation within a fixed range is an intriguing idea.
Analogue controls are infinitely adjustable, but a compressor is always a compressor.
Contrast this with a Raspberry Pi, or any digital device, where the range is configurable across an effectively infinite set of potential outputs, but the variation, i.e.
the resolution, is locked.
Analogue devices, then, have a kind of welcoming quality that lets you feel a more direct connection to their inner workings.
You know, this knob in particular is doing something specific somewhere in there.
Digital devices, in contrast, have a sort of impersonal obscurity.
This knob is a position output, same as all the rest, and it's taken into the mind-numbingly complex microprocessor, which does something with it.
Except sometimes it doesn't work, and you don't know why.
Digital systems do have their considerable advantages though.
They're modifiable, they're powerful, they're self-contained and easy to obtain, ready to go.
They have an incredibly wide range of potential functions.
They're easier to personalize, easier to design, at least for some functions.
They're more consistent, as in they have no variation in electrical outputs due to components, whereas an analog system might be different to another supposedly identical one because of tiny variations as a result of manufacturing different electrical components like resistors, capacitors, etc.
In other words, analog devices are much nicer, but digital devices are much easier to actually make.
The goal then is to create a device that matches as much of the warmth of purpose-built analog devices with the ease of use and flexibility of digital devices.
Wherever possible, the advantages of one should be leveraged to compensate for the disadvantages of the other.
