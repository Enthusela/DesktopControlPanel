This is more of a side note rather than to the core concept, but I'm reading through my design notes and stuff which I did very early on and I'd forgotten how much time I actually spent trying to angle this sound card up and trying to come up with a design that would push the sound card up and angle it towards me and it still fit under the case and have all this other stuff built in.Considering I ended up not doing it, in fact I completely forgot all about that once I decided not to do it, it's amusing to me how much time I actually spent on this doing the math measurements.
