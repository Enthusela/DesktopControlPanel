Future ideation, mood boarding.I only just added this journal entry, blog, whatever.I'm not entirely sure what to put in here, but basically once the concept and requirements are outlined, yeah, it'll just be a bit of a Google image search looking for interesting things and things that I like.So the first one obviously was the MOOC, MOOC, MOOC.I'm going to go with MOOC.I don't care if that's right.Also, I just realized this is going to be transcribed so it really doesn't matter how I pronounce it.But the AI is most likely to say MOOC synthesizer if I pronounce it MOOC synthesizer.So there we go.Anyway.Yeah, so the MOOC synthesizer, MOOCs in general have pretty much the exact kind of aesthetic I was looking for, you know, wood paneling with, sorry, wood cabinetry, wood furniture I guess you'd say, with kind of black, I think they're technically plastic but fucking I'm going for aluminium, so black aluminium with nice plating, nice black and silver sort of chrome around the aluminium details, just generally really nice looking stuff.So yeah, we've got a mini MOOC in there.I obviously looked at a whole bunch of studio, music studios that had the kind of real woody analog sort of feeling that I was going for, I was able to find quite a few of those, that's nice.And then, particularly I guess with that I was looking at more kind of layouts, the way equipment was laid out, sort of for inspiration for how I might design the economics of my panel even though I had a pretty good idea right from the get go of what I wanted.Also looked at, actually found some funnily enough some pieces of equipment that had almost my exact sound card integrated into a unit the way I wanted it to be and looked alright, but didn't love the look of that one, but I mean hey, someone had done it and it did look kind of cool and I figured I could make it look even nicer, which is what this is all about, right.12 hours, wood panelling, angled things.The purpose of this mood boarding was also to find possibly some examples of cabinetry and sort of the carpentry and how these sort of like wood panel devices were all fitting together.Looking at it now it's actually a bit annoying because...Anyway, I can update that later.It doesn't matter.I could do it.Anyway.Yeah, so looking for examples of the kind, not just spaces like studios, but also kind of equipment I was looking for the way it was put together and built.I knew it was feasible, obviously, but how specifically might I start to think about it just in case there was any kind of design considerations might come up when I look at, oh, you know, that's how this is actually all done and joinery and bolts and stuff would go here.So actually, you couldn't have anything on the faceplate here.In case, you know, it would clash or conflict or rub together, that kind of thing.Just getting the ideas out.So I could sort of ideate with something of a practical framework.I don't know.
