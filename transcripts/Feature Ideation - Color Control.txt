So at the same time I'm thinking, okay, what kind of functionality can I build into it? I'm also thinking on this about the aesthetic of the setup.And lighting is a big thing.You know, I want my apartment to be very cozy and like a, you know, like a sanctuary for myself basically.And as part of that, I want to integrate a lot of really warm lighting and a lot of very sort of gentle, non-distracting lighting.And all of this, if you're familiar at all with the kind of accessories you can get for PCs, you're probably thinking, well, that doesn't sound like PC lighting at all.PC lighting and especially PCs that are spec'd for gaming like the one I have, they're, you know, infamously colorful.They're, I mean, they look like garbage in my opinion.And a lot of it is sort of that rainbow-romantic aesthetic, which I want to go away from a lot.So, okay, if I'm trying to do that, then the question becomes, well, how much control do I have over the lighting in something like a PC case? And bear in mind with the rest of this discussion, the intention is always to try and kind of synchronize lighting with my PC and lighting with my room so that it can all kind of come together and it all makes like one thing, sort of very coherent aesthetic.Because as I mentioned before, the PC desk is such a large part of my living room, it basically has to become part of my living space aesthetic.Anyway, I'm waffling a bit.So that's the second kind of motivation.My PC desk is part of my living space aesthetic.Lighting is a huge part of the PC desk and I'm trying to figure out, okay, so how much control do I have over these lights? And as it turns out for my purposes, not a lot.It's okay.And like, if you want something, like if you want that gamer aesthetic, it works fine.But if you don't, sick of that shit, like I am, it starts to kind of suck because the devices tend to be locked into their own kind of manufacturer specific software.The software itself is bloatware, it runs badly, it crashes, it's not easy to use.But even when it does work, it doesn't have the kind of features you want.Like one thing for instance, I want specifically is temperature control.I want to be able to modify the quality of the lighting and the PC and by extension in the room based on color temperature from cool white all the way down to very warm orange.And as a kind of bonus feature, but another really cool feature, which I obviously cannot implement with manufacturer software is I want to be able to make that change happen over the course of day.I want the lighting in my room to be like, okay, well, yeah, during the day, make it all white and then as we go towards night, make it kind of orange.That'd be awesome.But I can't do that.So I'm thinking, okay, is there a way I can just hack these devices and control them myself? And once I had that idea, can I control these by myself? Then I had the core of the idea for, okay, well, what can I do with, actually starting again.So I've got the idea.Okay.I want to be able to control the lighting in my PC cases myself.I want to hack it, make it my own, write my own software for it.And so now I have my next idea for, well, what can go in the control panel? And the answer is, well, we can have switch gear about color control.We can have knobs for value control and we can have switches for different modes and that'll be really cool.
