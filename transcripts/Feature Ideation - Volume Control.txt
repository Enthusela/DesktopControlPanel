Feature Ideation Volume Control.So this one might actually be cheating.I think I could actually move this later into the thingy, like when it comes up, but I'm thinking about it now, so I'll talk about it now.Basically, I've got these three knobs in front of me.I've just tested it and it works for the color, but one of the things I'm doing is I'm playing games with my mates, and often I'll be running a mix of applications, like my game running, I'll have Discord running, and I'll sometimes have music apps or Spotify or Chrome or whatever running other shit.And that is kind of annoying from an audio balancing perspective, because sometimes your mates are really loud and the game is really quiet, or sometimes you want to quickly dip everyone down and just listen to some music in between game rounds, that kind of thing.And you can do it through the volume mixer in Windows, but then that requires you to be sort of operating a separate app while you're doing all this shit.It's not very good for if you just want to make quick adjustments to say your game volume or your Discord volume while you're gaming, that kind of thing.And I've got these knobs in front of me, so I thought, well, cool, what about, what if we had a separate mode for volume control? Switch mode, and now instead of controlling the knobs, controlling the knobs, sorry, now instead of the knobs controlling color values, they actually control separate app volumes, one for, say, like a voice chat channel, one for a music channel, and one for a gaming channel.That would be really nice and a really cool sort of quality of life update.
