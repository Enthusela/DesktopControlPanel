Ah, feature development, salvaging the VU meters.This one is fun and easy.I knew I wanted VU meters, I didn't know where to get VU meters.I looked online and VU meters were available but not as cheap as I'd like them to be.And they didn't like the aesthetic, so I was sort of dissatisfied with what I could find online.So I started looking around the room in frustration and what did I have? But as most of us have in our living room, I had a defunct 1993 Technics, what's it called, Technics Stereo Cassette Deck 612, which had two inbuilt VU meters with a really lovely silver backing, very clean design and the right size, right shape, just generally perfect.So I salvaged them.There's not much to tell really, I opened the case up and it was a simple process of just opening the case up and desoldering everything.I also took off the volume knob, or I took out the potentiometer, oh sorry, so the key point here, the VU meters were ideal and removing them was a very simple process of just desoldering them from the circuit board and popping them out of the frame, end of key point.One key point, I stole a potentiometer out of the VU meters as well because it was being used for the record level because this tape deck could take in, you know, you could plug in a mic and record shit onto tape and the recording level adjust for that had a really big, really satisfying, heavy, clicky volume knob and I thought this is just perfect for the main volume knob that will be associated with the PC in the final version, that sounds awesome.So I did that and it was awesome indeed, end of key point, enter.So the process of acquiring the VU meters was surprisingly simple but then the process for actually getting them connected to the sound card was also surprisingly simple.One of a few things during this project that was a very pleasant matter of Google, the exact thing that I'm looking for specifically as I can think of and lo and behold it exists and it's cheap.There's a company over in Queensland actually, JLM Audio, they make a whole bunch of components and modules and sub-modules for studio audio mixing equipment and things like EQ, like hardware EQ modules and spectrum analyzers and other stuff and wouldn't you know it, they just happen to have for 50 bucks a particular circuit kit that it's just a PCB that has two standard quarter inch audio jack plug sockets on one side and on the other side it has a four pin header that goes out to a VU meter and you plug your left and right channel into the left and right sockets, you plug your left and right VU meters into the left and right outputs and away you go.So that was perfect, it arrived in a week, took a couple hours to hand solder it all together and it worked first try.Boom, done, love it.So, and there's some images here I can put in there, you know, obviously it was very exciting to have it working so I guess you can consider this the first step to building the actual control panel that I did was set up this sound card with the little handmade circuit on the back and just double-sided taped the two VU meters to the top and it worked, wouldn't you know it.That's my first little control panel thing.So with that out of the way I actually started rearranging some stuff and trying to incorporate the hardware functionality I had up until that point into one sort of pseudo control panel that would start to feel a bit more like the real thing and I could get a sense of how it was going to work ergonomically, and that was really nice.
