Feature Ideation, E Ink Display So this was another feature I liked that you made as well, it was a very tactile feature that I knew almost immediately that I wanted on this When I was thinking of what could fill the spaces on the control panel It was pretty clear that the sound parts would be off to the left, the controls would be off to the right and there would be this space in the middle And I just really like E Ink Displays, I've liked them ever since I first got a Kindle, there's something about the lack of backlighting and the purely ambient reflected light There's something very much about the matte finish, zero emitted light look to them that embraces this whole kind of thing, that calm technology That's another thing I'll probably put together as well, but that was an underlying ethos that this bit of equipment I really wanted to express it with And if that sounds a bit artsy-fartsy, well consider this as my house, this whole thing is very much forming a key part of the aesthetic of my entire living space And so yes, I will use it to express a philosophy and a design theory of how tech can be And so it fit in very naturally when you have the concept of warm natural lighting combined with analog electronic components Even though they're obviously very digital, very modern, E Ink Displays matched that very well This kind of idea of calm passive technology, where there would just be this display in the middle of the screen and it wouldn't be very useful It wouldn't necessarily have a whole lot of functionality built into it But the purpose was more...actually I'll tell you what the purpose was I think I'd had this idea, and actually this is something...I've forgotten about this, but for a long time, especially at work and at home and stuff I would often put a world clock, like a sort of Mikada projection, great circle, maybe a world clock on Because I liked the way it showed me where I was and it kind of kept me in touch with the sort of cycle of time That sounds very artsy-fartsy obviously, but it does, you know, it's all too easy, especially when doing work like programming work Where you can get really into design, it's all too easy to sort of...you know, the days blend into one, time sort of flashes past That's what I really liked, this whole idea of having a kind of much slower pace Actually that's another sort of key point here, enter, enter As much as calm technology, I also like slower technology Utilising technology to actually reduce the perceived flow of time rather than increase it, which seems to be what so much of it is about And this sort of factors in very well with things like world clocks and 24-hour time Actually this factors in, finishing off the key point here So the idea in general of having a 24-hour clock type thing that would act as a kind of reminder to slow things down Really sounded nice, end of key point, enter, enter Further to key point 12, we'll probably talk a little bit about this The Watchie Chronometer project that I built, which was essentially the same thing It was like a 24-hour clock sunrise, sunset loop thingy It was sort of the initial expression of this idea of, yeah, you know what, I'd like tech to actually be kind of calm and chill And this is a way we can do that, end of key point, enter, enter So putting together what I just thought of with the E-Ink display and all that shit together Yeah, so straight away, in summary, the E-Ink display was a feature that came to mind very quickly I especially like the idea of, since E-Ink display is obviously by default just black and white Could have the default graphics on the display be black background with white overlay Reason being that that could then be very neatly integrated into a black aluminium faceplate, which I knew I wanted And that would create the impression, hopefully, of this E-Ink display which is kind of blended in flush with the panel itself Because there's no emitted light, and especially when not looked at directly It would appear as if almost these white lines describing the surface of the earth or whatever It almost emerged from the panel itself That was a really cool idea, I really liked that And so that stuck with the design pretty much since the very beginning as the kind of centrepiece that isn't the centrepiece A sort of low-key centrepiece Yeah
