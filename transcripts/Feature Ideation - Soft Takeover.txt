So, feature ideation soft takeover control.This was more of a sort of a necessary addition rather than a specific feature, but I knew that I now wanted to add two modes for the same controls.I had color control on the three control knobs and I also had separate app channel-based volume control for the PC.So I knew that I needed some way to switch between them.And one way I was familiar with, it's familiar in DJ equipment, music production equipment for instance, sure it is elsewhere, is a soft takeover where basically when you swap a control input from one mode to another, if the value associated with that mode is different to the value that the control input is actually pointing at, for instance if you switch to volume and volume is on max but the knob itself is pointed back at zero because that's where you had it set for the color value, what happens is that if you have no takeover then value is immediately updated, suddenly the volume switches from full to zero and you just get silence, which is probably not what you want.And going the other way, it's even worse.If you had it on zero and now you're on full, that's going to give you a bit of a shock.So soft takeover is when essentially the control value associated with the control input won't change until the output from the control input actually matches that value.So in other words, if you're having your color at zero and your volume in the background is at full and then you switch from color to volume control, the volume will stay at full until you physically move the control over to full.And then they lock together and now if you move it down, say by one, then the volume will come down by one and then two, blah blah blah.Similarly, if you then switch it back to, say you move volume to half and now you switch back to color control mode, color control won't jump to half, it'll stay at zero until you move the knob all the way back down to zero and then you can start to bring it up.So that's soft takeover control.
