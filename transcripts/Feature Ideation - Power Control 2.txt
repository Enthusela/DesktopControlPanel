Side note for the feature radiation on the power control, once I originally, before I even knew what I would use for them, I knew I wanted some nice heavy, satisfying toggle switches to kind of flick up.I figured if I had a row of them, then turning on my PC desk could become this cool thing kind of like, imagine like starting up an old World War II era fighter jet, and you know you come along and it's like click click click click click, and it all boots up.So that would be really sweet.And so that was the main sort of motivation, that was how the design sort of came together, and then I thought well look, what if I had one more, and a toggle switch that actually starts up the PC itself.So the idea for that would be to have a momentary toggle switch, it's spring return, just like the button on the PC case, the power button, wire them in somehow, start wiring it up, and so then you know you run along the switch, all these switches are firing off, they're turning on lights, they're turning on screens and shit, and then the last one turns on the PC itself.That would be sweet.Especially because the one before that turns on the lights in the PC so you can see it light up, and then the last one you flick and the fan starts spinning and it warms up, so the whole thing just comes to life as you flick along these switches.That sounded really fun, I wanted that.
