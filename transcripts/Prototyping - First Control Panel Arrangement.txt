Just a quick one, feature development, first prototype control panel.Not so much a real feature or anything but, you know, I don't know, might as well just quickly talk about once I had the eight device LED control blah blah blah blah blah blah, working in my PC case, I had a little breadboard with the control knobs and all of the little thingy-thangs on there.And I also had the DU meters working my sound cards, so bringing it all together, or the idea was to bring it all together into sort of the first prototype control panel, which was just a sound card and a breadboard next to each other.So that's exactly what I did.I spent probably a day on this, most of which was just soldering together and finding different jumper cables and ribbon cables and stuff to basically craft a custom, what would you call it, a custom cabling solution to run all the way from the back of my PC to the center of my desk, which turned out to be delightfully fiddly.And then just rearranging the desk to put, you know, the control, the sort of the knobs on one hand and the sound card on the other.And you know what? It's fun.It was fun.I said at the start that this was kind of a silly one, barely a feature, but the key point, this was the first step towards really starting to dial in the ergonomics of the control panel and seeing what actually works here, and what would I like, and that kind of thing.And actually, you know, to prove my point, it was only after sort of experimenting with the control knobs and that sort of thing on the...For the color control, that was when I had the idea while I was playing video games, well hey, wouldn't this be cool if I could swap it around and do different volume controls on an app-by-app basis for the PC.I knew that I wanted multiple controls on each knob, and I knew that that idea was going to be there, and there would be some kind of takeover functionality to switch between them smoothly.But that was the first sort of need-based idea I had, where I was like, hey, wouldn't it be cool if we had this? Yeah, simple change, looks kind of silly, but it got me one step closer to reality, and that really spurred the creative process.It was really good.
