Alright, so feature ideation 2 was power control.So I mentioned this is all going into a very sort of centerpiece PC desk setup, it's going to form the aesthetic of my apartment.As part of that I've done a whole bunch of cable management, hidden all the cables, hidden all the power supply, you know all that good shit.Now the only issue with this is that all the power boards are under the desk now.And I've got a lot of glass, you know I've got a PC, I've got two screens, I've got two powered monitors, I've got a powered external soundbar, so I have a whole lot of shit that's consuming power.And so this is another one of these ideas that, you know, sounds very simple, it's a very simple problem to solve and ends up being a shit ton of work, but basically the idea was well, wouldn't it be nice if all this stuff I could just turn on and off from my desk in my chair without getting up a limb.And so I thought yeah that'd be great, and then I thought well that'd be cool because then the switches, could we somehow incorporate them into the control panel.And the obvious thought was well, yeah, simple switch, work them into a relay or do my own wiring to sort of open and close mains power outlets.Terrible idea in my case because it's a rental and I don't want to do 240 volt wiring because if something is faulty and something catches fire then I'm screwed.So, if I don't burn up, well good luck getting insurance money for that.Idea is to have control of mains outlets through the control panel but without doing any mains wiring and quick Google, come up with, yeah you can get remote control power outlets.So there's idea three.Switch gear on the control panel to control the PC desk devices, power them up, power them down from the mains without doing any mains wiring but instead using remote control mains outlets.Should be simple right?
