Feature Ideation, Aircon Control.This has got to be my favourite of the really silly laziness based functions on this thing.I'm in my living room, I have my Aircon remote and I have to turn around and press the button, or I have to point it behind me to make changes and shit like that.That's mildly annoying.At the same time, this is after I've poached some parts off my tape deck, I have these three push buttons, these push toggle buttons, toggle switches that I don't use, I'm like what can I use for that? And then it hits me and I think, you know, even at the time I laugh because this is so dumb, but yeah, I will use these three buttons to control my Aircon and I will do it by hiding an infrared receiver transmitter somewhere in the room and spoofing the Aircon remote control by copying the, you know, typical spoofing, you know, point the Aircon remote at the sensor, copy the codes, point the transmitter at the Aircon, send the codes back out again.I thought this would be simple.I was wrong.But more on that later.
